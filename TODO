-get elements playing audio at right time intervals
-background change colors slowly, yet psychodelically
-add copyright to footer, add keyboard instructions(s: save, i: instrument, space: clear)
-keep it playing when focus is not on that window
-tones should be switch off able while they're being played, currently they aren't.
-matrix cannot be selected once it's been switched from in the instruments panel.  Must be a listener decoupling.

-look into getting SASS to abstract away vendor prefixes (compass)
-get sass to include ceaser-easing correctly and make a non-linear burst animation
-get new instruments - Zyn: SynthPiano(FM Synth 1, BinaryPiano1), Pads(Sine Pad)
