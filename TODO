-maybe each matrix should really have a separate $el for each state it can be in.
 tracked, staged, or live.  Or maybe, the app should maintain one matrix, and have
 different view objects that face the world and respond to different things.  They can
 listen to the matrix and learn when to detach() themselves from the DOM.  
 Each matrixView has a view for each of it's variously faced $els.  
 Each of these views - say the liveEl, the stageEl, the trackEl - knows about
 its parent view.  Plus the parent knows about the children.  Communication.

-double click text to change staged and tracked instrument
-on loading from string, should fail gracefully if string is wrong
-bug where instrument is tracked AND NOT staged
-remove long url once info is extracted
-add mobile-fu or something and ditch mobile devices
-x-frame-options is a tad sketch ATM

-big text when paused, saved, play matrix, play lotus
-Add ToneLotus to list of backbone examples on backbonejs.org

-matrices in track should have some kind of text wrap or something - was an option for this, forget already.  like hard-wrap or something.
-why is, in .track.droppable, $ref turning into the entire html document sometimes????
