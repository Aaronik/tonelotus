-implement tone pause when not on page * won't work with window.onblur
-fix distortion on sine_pad
-make the updateTime form a view of its own
-background change colors slowly, yet psychodelically
-click and drag to enable squares
-tones should be switch off able while they're being played, currently they aren't. * they're dropping below some div below them, and that's blocking their click
-separate Backbone.trigger calls into namespaced calls, can be done?
-look into getting SASS to abstract away vendor prefixes (compass)
-get sass to include ceaser-easing correctly and make a non-linear burst animation
-get new instruments - Zyn: SynthPiano(FM Synth 1, BinaryPiano1), Pads(Sine Pad)
