-big text when paused, saved, play matrix, play lotus

-Audio files should be passed out by a controller to a collection.  Then they should be mined from that collection to be played.
 -or even each tone view could have a model, that model belongs to the collection.  If I then mess around with the models, without
 -telling them which collection they are part of, will my collection still know about all those models?  Are model URLs and collections
 -one to one?

-why does tone_view have selected() and not just ask directly for isSelected, or even make selected a boolean
-yummiloader - fix or delete from app.js, stylesheets folder, javascripts folder, gemfile, app.scss, classes from main-wrapper in app.html.erb
-Add ToneLotus to list of backbone examples on backbonejs.org
-remove all the masterlistener stuff from the router, maybe make a new class called MasterListener which is actually a router.
 -put all the things from tonelotus.js and the router in there.  It's the conductor.
-look into getting SASS to abstract away vendor prefixes (compass)

-matrices in track should have some kind of text wrap or something - was an option for this, forget already.  like hard-wrap or something.
-handle when staged matrix is dragged into matrix-wrapper and there's already an instance of that instrument in existence
-why is, in .track.droppable, $ref turning into the entire html document sometimes????
