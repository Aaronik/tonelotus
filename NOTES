-Nov 11 left off at matrices, after staged, can be redrawn to their exact former glory.  Must call delegateEvents to work, but no probs.
 -plan was to implement draggable, and allow the matrix to be dragged back into the matrix-wrapper to re-render it or whatever.  redraw().
 -next is just a short (hahahahahahahahahhahahahahahhahahaha) hop to getting the track(s) working.

-to add a new instrument: change dropdown on the right in appropriate erb file, add stuff to assign_tone.js, add listener to router
-very minor speed can be had by minimizing or removing animations, just making divs.  z-index will have to be worked out.
 -Howler is not crucial.  html5 audio will work as well.

-cool instruments: Synth(Analog Filter 1)

-CYCLE OF SELECTING NEW INSTRUMENTS
 -user clicks new instrument
 -backbone emits trigger with new instrument name
  -router only party that hears it
  -if that instrument exists in the matrix hash, which is should, it draws that without reinitializing it.
  -if
